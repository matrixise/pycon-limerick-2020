In 2015 the National Archives released files which had been compiled by the Dublin Metropolitan Police 100 years beforehand. From June 1915 to April 1916 they followed members of groups such as Sinn F?in, the Irish Volunteers and the Gaelic League and reported on who they were seen talking to. Using these files, the python library networkX and the open source network analysis package Gephi, I was able to build a social network of the interactions recorded.

The resulting network supports well known facts about the planning around the 1916 Rising but also presents interesting questions surrounding figures who are rarely mentioned in Irish history but feature prominently in the network. During the reporting on these files at the time of their release these figures were overlooked as their importance could not be seen by a cursory glance. The network can also be used to understand what type of information the D.M.P. had in relation to the separatist movement and judge the effectiveness of their intelligence gathering.

This talk would serve as an introduction to social network analysis in python and the use of the networkX library and Gephi. If there is already a talk on this area I could discuss the use of data science in the study of Irish history. I have also applied natural language processing to the Anglo Irish Treaty debates and am currently looking at how python can be used to analyse the police books containing all arrests made by the DMP from 1905-1918.

All these projects focus on taking large, inaccessible data sets, presenting and visualising them in interesting and informative ways and extracting valuable findings from them. Some findings and visualisations of the 1916 network can be found here: http://www.anquantarbuile.com/social-network-of-the-1916-rising and the Anglo Irish Treaty debate project can be found here: http://www.anquantarbuile.com/treaty-debates
