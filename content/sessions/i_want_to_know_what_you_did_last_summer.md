We all love to learn about the cool things others make, but we tend to think those who write or talk publicly about their projects are rare and specially gifted individuals, while in fact they are normal people just like you and I. I started sharing my projects with the community many years ago, and all sorts of good things happened to me as a result of that, so in this talk I’m going to make a case for why you should start sharing too!
