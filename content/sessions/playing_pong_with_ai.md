My project was based on using reinforcement learning specifically Q-learning and model predictive control to develop an agent that can play the atari game of PONG.

* I coded in Python to create my agent and used the OpenAI gum library to set up the game environment.
* This project was to prove the concept that AI can be made safer and reliable when used in collaboration with control engineering tools.
* The work from my project is now published online at https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04400?context=cs.LG
