The talk will be about GraphQL technology. What is GraphQL and why we might use it.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using GraphQL.
I will talk about the main concepts in GraphQL like schemas, types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
I will show how to implement GraphQL with python using an example with Graphene and Django.
I will have a demo with a sample app build in Django that will serve as a GraphQL API.
