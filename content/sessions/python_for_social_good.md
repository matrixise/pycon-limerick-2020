As a data scientist, I am into making meaning from data and Python is the main tool for it.

However does this meaning translate into impact; and how can we come up with projects that provide huge societal impact.

I will delve into some example projects of my own while also giving examples of how Python helped with quick analysis.
This talk will be different from your traditional Python talks because of the interactive nature while we try to think of “Data Science for Social Good” projects.
